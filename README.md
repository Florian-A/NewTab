InfiniseGo
==========

A minimalist start page with quick access to a few popular search engines.

In the past there’s been some confusion about the purpose of this site. Some took it as my suggestions for a better Google design, which couldn’t be further from the truth. InfiniseGo is nothing more than a personal start page for myself and everybody else who finds it to make their life easier.

In other words, it is deliberately minimalistic, with many features hidden behind plain sight, just in order to get out of your way and be efficient to use.
